Our predix page is at [1]. Our devpost page is at [2], and our github page is at [3].
To setup our predix page, I followed the tutorials at [4], [5], [6]. 
We used Google maps, and started by following the tutorial at [7]. We fixed the coordinate system problem, so it wasn’t showing the car in the Detroit River, by following [8].
I had both a camera and a sensehat [9] connected to a raspberry pi. I followed a tutorial to get the camera working [10] and another tutorial to get the sensehat working [11]. 
To put the pictures on our website, I set up an apache webserver on the raspberry pi following the tutorial at [12]. I tried to set up a restAPI server too so that we could get and post accelerometer data. To setup the restAPI server, I followed the instructions at [13]. I think I was able to set it up and working, but I ran out of time to try to figure out how to use it and integrate it with our website.
I used Twilio [14] for texting. I followed the tutorial at [15] for the javascript code for twilio.
